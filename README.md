# On Self-Replicating Sets

[link to edit page](pageeditor.html)

## 1. Theory of Self-Replication

  - Von neummann
  - Merkle and Drexler
  - Penrose
  - Conway and cellular automata, "artificial life"
  - the flaws inherent in the Turing machine model, 
  - relationship of this flaw with broader problem with reductionist western science: the separation of the observer from the system.  The removal of the scientist or philosopher from the system they are studying.    

## 2. Self-Replication in Human society

  - culture in pre-industrial societies
  - religion: scripture and culture and broader society structures
  - a more accurate description of "tech" which is a more powerful descriptor for what we call "computers" than the Turing machine, including: venture capital,media, global finance,central banks, government intervention, education, culture, geography, mining, military force, mining, oil, global materials transport
  - viral information vs. complex replicating systems

## 3. The Mathematics of the Open Web

  - add up mobile phones, laptops, desktops, server farms and there are easily 10 potential web servers per person for a 10 billion person population.  Each machine can be assumed to be able to host 10 gigabytes, or 100 gigabytes per person.  If we consider the space of files like this one that can fit in under 1 megabyte or 0.001 gigabytes, there can be 100,000 text files like this one *for each person on Earth*.
  - Given that there could be easily this universe of open servers all running the same basic code, we can build a collection of 1 quadrillion(10 billion times 100 thousand) self-replicating documents like this one. 
  - If these documents are used to document all the things we interact with in our lives such as technology, culture, economics, philosophical ideas, art, etc, the space in which we can build a self-replicating Universe of Things which represent all things we can desire, making the Open Web a medium for exchange of self-replicating things based on our desires...
