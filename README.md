## 1. Theory of Self-Replication

  - Von neummann
  - Merkle and Drexler
  - Penrose
  - auxons and space mine based robot factories
  - Conway and cellular automata, "artificial life"
  - the flaws inherent in the Turing machine model, 
  - relationship of this flaw with broader problem with reductionist western science: the separation of the observer from the system.  The removal of the scientist or philosopher from the system they are studying.    

## 2. Self-Replication in Human society

  - culture in pre-industrial societies
  - religion: scripture and culture and broader society structures
  - a more accurate description of "tech" which is a more powerful descriptor for what we call "computers" than the Turing machine, including: venture capital,media, global finance,central banks, government intervention, education, culture, geography, mining(with extreme specificity), landfill, metals processing, military force, mining, oil, global materials transport
  - viral information vs. complex replicating systems

## 3. The Power of the Open Web

  - add up mobile phones, laptops, desktops, server farms and there are easily 10 potential web servers per person for a 10 billion person population.  Each machine can be assumed to be able to host 10 gigabytes, or 100 gigabytes per person.  If we consider the space of files like this one that can fit in under 1 megabyte or 0.001 gigabytes, there can be 100,000 text files like this one *for each person on Earth*.
  - Given that there could be easily this universe of open servers all running the same basic code, we can build a collection of 1 quadrillion(10 billion times 100 thousand) self-replicating documents like this one. 
  - If these documents are used to document all the things we interact with in our lives such as technology, culture, economics, philosophical ideas, art, etc, the space in which we can build a self-replicating Universe of Things which represent all things we can desire, making the Open Web a medium for exchange of self-replicating things based on our desires...
  - evaluation of complexity of fully networked collection of evolving documents, comparison to brain of neurons

  

## 4. Self Replicating Sets

### Motivation and definitions

naive set theory.  sets as collections of abstract objects without the ZF axioms. sets are denoted by curly braces

self replicating sets always have an externality.  The degrees of freedom of that externality determines the degrees of freedom of the set containing it.  The more general an element is the more degrees of freedom it has.  

### This Set

<pre>
On Self Replicating Sets = 
{
  The desire of the author to describe self-replicating sets,
  A description of self-replicating sets,
  The means to replicate this set
}
</pre>

<pre>
Desire = 
{
  Desire to share beautiful mathematics with other people,
  Desire to create ideas which can empower people to change society with their will
}
</pre>

<pre>
Description = 
{
  narrative structure,
  definitions,
  digital text document,
  pdf document,
  references
}
</pre>

<pre>
Replication = 
{
  code replication,
  server replication,
  pdf replication,
  media: email, post cards, posters, signs, commercial social media,
  manuscript editing to evolve and fork the Document
}
</pre>


## 5. Implications

*Language is how the mind parses reality.*

*From each according to their desire, to each according to their desire.*

  By building a universe of self replicating things based on the desire of the author of the documents we can build a universe for our minds to live in 

The use of directing evolution with desire to create better sets. 

The goal of the technological complete set, with evolution to guide to that goal.  How robots built from trash can be integrated into the universe of self replicating sets to build closed loops where externalities are "sun, earth, water, trash" and nothing more.  No money, no mining, no property.  Everything is physical, everything is fractal, everything is recursive.  Look at the insects, look at the fungi, language is how the mind parses reality.
